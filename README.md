# WhyDrugUse
Using biological and lifestyle data to predict the type and severity of drug use in individuals.

This project attempts to predict drug use in indivudals using biological data such as their age or sex etc. and numerical conversions of the "big 5" psychological markers as well as lifestyle data such as how often they eat or drink certain things. The predictions are in the form of how often they might take a certain substance, or the severity of use of substances. Poster I created is included, please check it out!

## Summary of abilities

- Conducts EDA (exploratory data analysis) on medium-sized data-set (~1500 individuals) and shows how to get a feel for a data-set
- Uses multiple machine learning models (neural networks, random forests, gradient boosting trees, GLM's etc.) to come to conclusions on drug use
- Shows the ability of the powerful <a href="http://ggplot2.org/">ggplot2</a> r library 
- Works backwards and attempts to predict lifestyle and behaviour from types/severity of drug use!

## Requirements and Installation

## Contributing

Feel free to use the results or code for your own investigations, and if you want to make improvements or corrections then don't hesitate to let me know! I'm sure a lot of the Neural networks I used could be more streamlined...

## Credits

XGBoost library - A significant portion of this investigation uses the XGBoost library, a very effcient implementation of gradient boosting trees in R. Documentation available <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xgboost/index.html">here.</a>

Dr. C. Colijn - Data-set and coursework idea itself was given to us as part of the M34A50 module at Imperial College London, lectured by Dr. Colijn.
